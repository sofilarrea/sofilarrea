### Hi there 👋

✨ I’m Sofía ✨, mother of Benicio and Jacinta. My life has revolved around dentistry 	👩‍⚕️ for 15 years, but I always felt that there was something wrong with it… like a splinter in my mind. The first time I discovered programming 👩‍💻 I felt like Alice falling down the rabbit hole 🐇, and discovered a wonderful world, with amazing people I want to work with. I want to learn about this world, because I want to be an active part of it, I want to contribute to it.

 Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🐶 I love animals specialy dogs!
- 🏋️‍♀️ I enjoy doing crossfit on my free time
- 🥰 Also love doing puzzles and read historical novels 📚	

- 💬 Some skills I have: 
      ▪️ Ruby
      ▪️ Ruby on Rails
      ▪️ PostgresSQL
      ▪️ Javascript
      ▪️ Css / Scss
      ▪️ HTML
      ▪️ Trello
      ▪️ Figma
